=head1 NAME

bfbin2xmlss - convert Byfl output to XML Spreadsheet format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bfbin2xmlss> I<input_file.byfl> [I<output_file.xml>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, applications instrumented with Byfl write measurement data
to a binary F<.byfl> file.  B<bfbin2xmlss> converts such files to
Microsoft Excel XML Spreadsheet 2003 format (henceforth, "XML
Spreadsheet").  XML Spreadsheet has been superseded by Office Open XML
(ECMA-376) but is represented by a simple, single, XML file, which is
more convenient to process (e.g., with XSLT).  Both LibreOffice Calc
and Microsoft Excel 2003+ can read XML Spreadsheet files directly.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<bfbin2xmlss> has no command-line options.  The program accepts the
name of a F<.byfl> file to read and an XML Spreadsheet file to create.
If not specified, the name of the data file will be the same as that
of the input file but with F<.byfl> replaced with F<.xml>.  (If the
file name does not end in F<.byfl> then F<.xml> will be appended to
the file name.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

The simplest usage is just

    $ bfbin2xmlss myprog.byfl

which produces F<myprog.xml>.

If the F<.byfl> file is expected to be used only to produce an XML
Spreadsheet file and then deleted, one can save time and disk space by
writing Byfl binary output to a named pipe and running B<bfbin2xmlss>
on that named pipe:

    $ mkfifo myprog.pipe
    $ bfbin2xmlss myprog.pipe myprog.xml &
    $ env BF_BINOUT=myprog.pipe ./myprog
    $ rm myprog.pipe
